# Welcome to my profile

Hi, I'm <strong>Lüder</strong> and besides Kite Surfing, and beeing with my son, I really enjoy going on adventures in the world and creating and fixing things around me. I love woodworking and engineering and creating and designing web-applications / apps. Currently I'm living in Tunis, Tunesia, moving back to Germany in March / April `24.
